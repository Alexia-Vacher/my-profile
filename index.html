		<h2>Horse Riding</h2>
			<p>
				I come from a family where everyone rides. This, I started horse riding very young and fell in love with it. I’ve been riding for over 15 years now and couldn’t even imagine living without it. It helps me clear my mind and has taught me many important skills in life such as patience and team work.

    <h2>Writing</h2>
      <p>
        Writing is very important to me because it is very therapeutic and develops my creativity. I’ve always loved inventing stories, I used to tell stories to my brothers and sisters to help them fall asleep when they were younger.
      </p>
  </div>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>
				I spend a lot of time listening to music or writing music because it helps me think and put things in perspective. I listen to all kinds of musics from classical music to rap but also rock, jazz, blues, techno, etc.
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Traveling</h2>
			<p>
				My dad is a pilot so I started traveling very young and had the opportunity to discover a lot of different countries and cultures which allows me to be more open minded and try to understand people even though they’re very different from me.
